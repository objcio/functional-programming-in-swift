# Functional Swift by [objc.io](https://www.objc.io)

This repository contains the code from the [Functional Swift book](https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift). For some chapters we've packaged the code as playgrounds. For others (QuickCheck, Diagrams, and Parser Combinators) the sample code is available as plain Swift files or as Xcode project (Spreadsheet Application).

Please file an issue for questions/suggestions or other feedback!

Enjoy!
